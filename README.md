# Tuple Out Dice Game 🎲
Description:

The Tuple Out Dice Game is a simple dice rolling game where the player aims to score as many points as possible by rolling three dice. 

The game follows these rules:

- Each turn, the player rolls three dice.
- If the player rolls three identical dice, they "tuple out," and their score for the turn becomes 0. 
- The player can choose to keep rerolling the dice to improve their score, or they can choose to stop and keep their score for the turn.
- The goal is to accumulate the highest score possible. The game tracks a high score, and the player can try to beat their previous high score during each turn.

    **Disclaimer: the program is supposed to "fix" two dice that are rolled to be the same value, not allowing them to be rolled again. I could not figure this out, so only three dice rolled as the same value in a turn will cause a "tuple out". Therefore, all three dice are always rerolled, regardless of whether two dice are the same.*

## How to Play
1. The game will begin by asking if you want to start a new turn.
2. Each turn consists of rolling three dice. The program will tell you what each dice shows.
3. If all three dice show the same value (e.g., 1, 1, 1), you "tuple out" and your score for the turn becomes 0.
4. After each roll (or reroll), the game will calculate the score for that turn and add it to your overall score for the round.
5. You can choose to keep rolling or stop. If you stop, your score for the round will be locked in and added to your high score if it beats your previous high score.
6. The game will continue until you choose to exit or until you tuple out- whichever occurs first.# consolidation_project
